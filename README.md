**SERVER-SIDE:**
1. **"ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017"-**
I used a connection string that works on the local computer, the connection string must be changed to work in the cloud

**2. data/ApplicationContext.cs**
There I define the connection to my database, and from there I access my database in Mongo Db


**3. controllers/petsController.cs**
I did the bonus of calculating the sum of the ages.
I did not use it on the client side - on the client side I calculated the sum of the ages separately according to the instructions


**CLIENT-SIDE-**
1. src/api/petsApi.js
A consolidated file where I consolidated the definition of HTTP requests to the database.
